						STOP SYSTEMD LICENSE

The Stop Systemd License is a mostly free license for software. It is intended
to be compatible with other software licenses by extending them and adding one
simple restriction aimed at sparing users the functional abuse(s) of systemd
while also saving the Free Software world from its cancerous nature.

The infamous systemd project is designed to take away init freedom and establish
 a dangerous monoculture by unjustifiably encroaching upon every piece of
software it encounters. The Stop Systemd License is designed to put an end to
this by explicitly forbidding any dependency, integration or interoperability
with it.

Quoting the GNU GPL version 3: 
«To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights 
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.» The Stop Systemd License 
simply asks you to focus this common courtesy on the choice of init system. 
Don't add systemd dependencies. Don't use any of its libraries or
functionalities. Don't fall for it. Don't become part of the problem.

Any derivative work can only be distributed under the terms of this license.

STAY UNIX. STAY PORTABLE.
